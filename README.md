## Summary

AI assistant sport app for various sport activities. It would contain set of predefined sports, and app users would get insights tailored to their physical abilities. The app would assist with progress in chosen sport. Initial step would be to start with just one sport as proof of concept. Good example would be Brasilian Jiu-Jitsu sport.


## Background

My personal motivation is behind this project idea. I follow some grappling sports, and it looks like modern grappling gets overwhelmed with numerous techniques, styles, rules and mental approach. For example, Brazilian jiu-jitsu is quite popular sport nowadays. It has rather steep learning curve, since there is a lot of techniques, and their variations. Thus, additional assistance might help to learn about the sport and progress faster.


## How is it used?

Such assistant could be used by people who would like to create some training plan and learning path. For example, BJJ athletes may be divided onto 2 categories: “top” and “bottom” players. Top players prefer to stay on their legs and try to pass opponent’s legs. Bottom players might prefer to sit immediately after match starts and try to sweep their top opponents. It creates 2 different learning paths and techniques.

One more value would be training diary. Some athletes have such diaries and share in there their training process. This could be leveraged by the app, like athletes could record their posts with voice, and app would transfer it to organised text notes. Such text notes cold be used to compare progress with some benchmarks.


## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources could be as follows: 
* Data collected from user. User could enter their anthropological data like height, weight as well as training data, for example, how many times per week user trains.
* Diary data could be used for voice transformation to text and further text analysis.

I believe there would be need for statistical data as well. Based on my quick research, such data would be beneficial:
* Statistical data about athletes' physiological profiles. There is attached link for such article.
* Some manually collected data from BJJ competitions. For example, tournament data compilation can be found here:
 [BJJ Heroes Data Analysis](https://www.bjjheroes.com/editorial/bjj-data-analysis-essay-almanac)
The data could be used to find possible correlations of most effective submission by athlet's weight and apply it with Machine Learning methods.

## Challenges

This project won't replace actual training sessions and coach instructions. It merely would try to assist with trainings and try to provide some insights based on statistical data. Another challenge would be to keep trained models with actual data. Also, it looks like data scraping might be challenging. I hoped to find statistical data on International BJJ federation website, but there are mostly results of events without much details about athletes, winning statistics, and athlet's physical data.


## What next?

There would be need for data science skills for proper data collection and refining. Skills for creating and training ML models would be welcomed as well. App development skills for creating mobile and web apps and connecting it with backend and trained models.
